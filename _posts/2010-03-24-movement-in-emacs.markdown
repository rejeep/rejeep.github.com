As everyone new to Emacs know, adapting to Emacs key binding takes
quite a while. When I first started using Emacs, even though I found
for example **C-x k** a quite odd key binding, I tried to learn it, no
questions asked.

As I got more comfortable with Emacs I adopted more and more Emacs
standard key bindings. But there was this one thing I just couldn't
understand why to use. I'm talking about the movement keys: **C-n**,
**C-p**, **C-f**, **C-b**, **M-f** and **M-b**.

I read books and tutorials on Emacs and everywhere it said **these are
the movement keys** in Emacs. But more importantly, none of them
mentioned **why you should use them**.

I never found out **why** by reading any Emacs material. The way I
found out was by just starting to use them. I thought, if I use
Emacs, I should go the whole nine yards. So I started using the
movement keys and after a while I realized **why** you should use them.

These are the main reasons why you should use the movement keys
instead of the arrow keys:

1. Using the arrow keys is **highly inefficient**! They are way off
   from where your fingers are when you type. Moving your hand over
   each time you want to move the cursor, is like getting a cop of
   coffee each time you create a new paragraph.
2. It is much more comfortable to use the movement keys.
3. They fit together much nicer with other Emacs key bindings.

I really hope this post help you drop those inefficient, ugly and
stupid arrow keys!

**Ps.**
Using the movement keys involve a lot of **Ctrl-key** usage, which
kills you little finger.
