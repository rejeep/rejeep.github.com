title: New Blog

Ever since I started blogging, I have used Wordpress on my own server,
but I never liked it for several reasons.

I have finally found the time and energy to migrate my blog from Wordpress
to the Awesome [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

The migration also lead to a new url, **tuxicity.se**. But the old url
**blog.tuxicity.se** will still work.

Unforuneately you will have to update the **RSS feed url** to
**http://feeds.feedburner.com/tuxicity**
