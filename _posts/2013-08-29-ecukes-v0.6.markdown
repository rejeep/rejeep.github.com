100 commits later and Ecukes `v0.6` is ready, full with new awesome
features. Here's a list of features and changes. If you are using
Ecukes you should read this because there are a few breaking changes.

## New features

1. Ecukes depends on Espuds by default, so you no longer have to add both `ecukes` and `espuds` as dependencies in your Cask-file
2. Support for reporters. These are currently supported:
  * dot (default)
  * magnars
  * spec
  * gangsta
  * landing
  * progress
3. To list all reporters, run the command `list-reporters` and to select a reporter, use `-r <reporter>` or `--reporter <reporter>`
4. Added `--timeout <seconds>` (`-t <seconds>`) option for async step definitions to specify custom timeout. If exceeded, an error occurs.
5. It's possible to run scenarios that matches pattern with `--patterns <*>` (`-p  <*>`)
6. It's possible to run scenarios that does not matches pattern with `--anti-patterns  <*>` (`-a  <*>`)
7. If you run and some scenarios fail, you can run only them with `--only-failing` (`-f`)
8. Add support to log error backtrace to file on error with `--error-log <file>` (`-l <file>`)
9. Support for default options via a `.ecukes` file (one option per row)

## Breaking changes

1. The `ECUKES_EMACS` variable is replaced in favor of `EMACS`
2. The `--dbg` option have changed name to `--debug`
3. The `--list-steps` is no longer an option but a commaned called `list-steps`
4. The `--new` is no longer an option but a commaned called `new`
5. Mode options have changed (and does no longer need to be first option):
  * `--script` (default)
  * `--win`
  * `--no-win` (was previously default)
6. All files are read as `utf-8`
7. Features files are fetched recursive if a directory specified
8. The deprecated `ecukes` binary in the Ecukes root has been removed, use `bin/ecukes` instead (Cask will do this automatically if you run `cask exec ecukes`)

It's also worth running `cask exec ecukes -h` and reading through the [new README](https://github.com/rejeep/ecukes.el/blob/master/README.markdown).
