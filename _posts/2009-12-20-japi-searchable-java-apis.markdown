Japi is a hobby project of mine that is intended to help browsing Java
APIs. Everyone knows that looking for a class in for example Java's
standard library isn't fun at all. IDE's can help a bit, but I still
think that the browser has major advantages in some cases.

Japi works like this. You register an account at
[japi.me](http://japi.me).
If you have your own an API, or you know of an API that does not exist
in Japi, you can add it yourself. When an API is added, it will appear
in the
[list of APIs](http://japi.me/apis).
The user that added the API can then scan it, which will fetch the
name of the classes into Japi.

To search APIs you must first add it as **Watchable**. You do that by
clicking **Watch** to the right of an API in the
[list of APIs](http://japi.me/apis).
Or by visiting a specific API and click Watch. The API will then
appear in the right sidebar. To search an API in that list, you simply
check that API and enter the desired query in the search field above.

More information about how to use Japi is found at the
[Get Started page](http://japi.me/pages/get_started).
