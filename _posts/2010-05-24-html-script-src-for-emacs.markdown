This weekend I attended a very successful Conference, Nordic Ruby in Gothenburg.
[Dr. Nic](http://drnicwilliams.com/) had a lightning talk about his
[HTML Script Src bundle for TextMate](http://github.com/drnic/html-script-src.tmbundle). I
found it neat and did a clone for Emacs. Check it out at
[Github](http://github.com/rejeep/html-script-src).
