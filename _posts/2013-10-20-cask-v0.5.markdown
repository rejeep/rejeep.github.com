Cask `v0.5` is released! The release mostly includes small changes
such as bug fixes, clean up and code refactoring. But there are a few
features worth mentioning.

## Upgrade command

Previously, updating Cask has been somewhat of pain. Now it's as
simple as running `cask upgrade`. This will upgrade Cask, but also all
of Cask's dependencies.

## Outdated command

Now you can find out what packages are outdated by running the command
`cask outdated`. This command will print a list of all dependencies
with a newer version available. It will print the package name,
current version and new available version.

## EPL

To handle the many quirks and inconsistencies in `package.el`, we
wrote a package called [epl.el](https://github.com/cask/epl), which is
a layer on top of `package.el`. It has a nice interface and works from
Emacs 23 to trunk.

## Google group

Development related discussion has been moved to the Google group
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cask-dev>. Please come over
and say hi!

## Cask v0.6

Cask is being actively developed and the future promises a lot of
features that will make Emacs package development a breeze. If you are
