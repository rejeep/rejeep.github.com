[Ecukes](http://ecukes.info) **v0.3** has been released. This is the list of changes:

* Lots of bug fixes, refactoring and added tests.
* New driver (no win) added and is default if no driver specified. Run in batch mode with **--script** and with full window with **--win**.
* Added **-h/--help** option.
* Added **--dbg** option that enables some debug options in Emacs.
* Messages are by default not printed to **STDOUT**. Use **--verbose** option to show.
* Alternate way of calling steps **(Given "this %s" "stuff")** <=> **(Given "this stuff")**
* Can run tagged scenarios with **--tags @foo,@bar**
* And a lot more... See [list of closed issues](https://github.com/rejeep/ecukes/issues?milestone=1&state=closed) and [diff](https://github.com/rejeep/ecukes/compare/0.2.1...v0.3.0) for more info.
