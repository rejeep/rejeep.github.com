[Japi](http://japi.me) is a hobby project of mine that is intended to help browsing Java
APIs. Everyone knows that looking for a class in for example Java's
standard library isn't fun at all. IDE's can help a bit, but I still
think that the browser has major advantages in some cases.

Japi works like this. You don't need an account to search APIs that
are already in Japi. However, if you have your own an API, or you know
of an API that does not exist in Japi, you can add it yourself. But
then you must first sign up.

If you didn't sign up for Japi, you just check the APIs you want to
search in the right sidebar and enter the query. If you did sign up
you have a little bit more customization options. To search APIs you
must first add it as **Watched**. You do that by clicking **Watch** to
the right of an API in the
[list of APIs](http://japi.me/apis).
Or by visiting a specific API and click **Watch**. The API will then
appear in the right sidebar. To search an API, you simply check
it and enter the query.

More information about how to use Japi is found at the
[Get Started page](http://japi.me/pages/get_started).
